<h1>Tony Stark gives TED talks for a post-Iron Man living</h1>
<p>He has done it many times before, and his 'If you're nothing without it then you shouldn't have it' motto is widely followed by the entire world.</p>

<p>"But I'm nothing without GTA V!" "If you're nothing without GTA V then you shouldn't have it." for example.</p>

<p>One day, the entire world is in a state of civil war and all the leaders of the world turn to Tony for help, knowing his advice could change the world forever. After the meeting, however, not only has the civil war been extended, it's getting worse!</p>

<p>Peter Parker, having dodged all the chaos to get to Tony, perches on top of the Empire State Building as Tony, in his Iron Man suit, hovers by.</p>

<p>'"What's going on, Mr. Stark?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the world is in civil war and after my TED talk it got worse right away, and it was on live TV."</p>

<p>Peter, knowing all of Tony's mistakes, asks "What did you tell them this time?"</p>

<p>"You seriously wanna hear it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Stark."</p>

<p>"If you're nothing without peace..."</p>
